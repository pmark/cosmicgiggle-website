<h2><p class="p2">The Cosmic Giggle constitution</p></h2>
<p class="p1"><i>(Guidelines for being a good participant and community member for Cosmic Giggle and Burning Man; written and maintained by Matt, Vicki and other proto-Gigglers)</i></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>1. Contribute.</b>   We're here to build something together, something awesome and inspiring, something worth celebrating.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>2. Giggle.</b>  This is supposed to be fun.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>3. Share the work; share the rewards.</b>  It takes a lot of effort, time, creativity, energy, and resources to make something as fantastic as Burning Man happen.  And it's immensely rewarding.  SO get your hands dirty!  If there is anything that needs taking care of, ask if you can help, get involved, make a friend.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>4. Come early, stay late. </b> Burning Man is more than just a party, it's a frame of mind.  This frame of mind takes time to build.  If you come just for the end you miss an important part of this process.  Plan to arrive by Wednesday at the latest and to stay until Monday to help with clean-up and dismantle.  This is a Leave No Trace event and we take that commitment seriously.   We're all in it together!  If you must arrive after Wednesday or leave before Monday, please contact the camp leaders to find out what else you can do to make up for that.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>5. Leave No Trace.</b> We are committed to doing our part to keep the playa clean. See the MOOP Map from last year (<a href="http://www.burningman.com/environment/playa_restoration/2006_moop_map.html"><span class="s1">http://www.burningman.com/environment/blog/?p=126)</span></a>, remember "don't let it hit the ground in the first place", and ask our resident Sista Trashmasters (Bridget &amp; Vicki) how to ensure Black Rock City is still welcome in the choicest parts of the playa and Cosmic Giggle is still welcome in the choicest parts of BRC.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>6. Gift yourself.</b> Serendipity rules! A gift of your energy or time is going to be the best thing of all.  No one here will tell you what to do or how to contribute.  Just do what you do, know what you know, and share that energy with others.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>7. Mandatory contributions.</b> #6 notwithstanding, there are a few things that just have to happen.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">  1.) Camp dues (budgeted expenses, divided by the camp membership) must be paid. You must pay your share. (Last year dues were ~ $150 per person.)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">  2.) You must be present for either setup or strike (truck loading and unloading in SF may be able to substitute for this).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">  3.) Volunteer for and help out with camp activities throughout the week:  kitchen duties, dish duties, trash recycling, repairs, moop sweeps, etc.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">  4.) Save enough space on the ride home so that you can take your share of trash, recycling, and grey water off the playa. Budget a couple of hours before you leave the playa for moop sweeping/cleanup outside our camp.  (As a theme camp we Gigglers have to contribute to overall clean up of Black Rock City.)</p>
